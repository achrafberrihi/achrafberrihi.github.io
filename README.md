## 🧠 Selected Projects

### 1. MoorMaster™ NXG – Predictive Maintenance System

In this project I developed machine learning models to predict component failures for a mooring system. I performed data pre‑processing, feature engineering, model selection (logistic regression and decision trees), and evaluation to improve maintenance scheduling and reduce downtime. The project involved working with IoT sensor data and implementing early‑warning algorithms.

Repository: [`/MoorMaster_ML_Maintenance`](./MoorMaster_ML_Maintenance)

### 2. Moroccan Recipes Web Scraper

I built a web scraper using Python’s BeautifulSoup to collect and organize traditional Moroccan recipes from public websites. The script extracts ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional information and stores the data in a structured format for analysis or sharing.

### 3. Prompt Engineering Demos

This collection contains examples of prompt designs for large language models such as GPT and LLaMA. Each prompt demonstrates techniques for classification, summarization, question answering, and creative tasks. The repository also includes evaluation scripts and notes on instruction tuning.
