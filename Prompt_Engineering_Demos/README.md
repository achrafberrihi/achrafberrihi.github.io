# Prompt Engineering Demos

This folder contains examples of prompt designs and experiments for large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA. Each example showcases different strategies for eliciting desired responses from the model.

## Contents

- `example_prompts.md` â€“ A markdown file with curated prompts, their rationale, and expected outputs.
- Additional scripts or notebooks can be added here for evaluation or fine-tuning experiments.

## How to Use

Use these prompts as inspiration when interacting with LLMs. Feel free to modify them for your own projects or integrate them into automated pipelines. Notes are provided alongside each prompt explaining why it works and what adjustments might improve the output.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
