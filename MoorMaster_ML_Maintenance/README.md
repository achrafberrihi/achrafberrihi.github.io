# MoorMaster™ NXG – Predictive Maintenance System

This project demonstrates a predictive maintenance workflow for a mooring system. It uses historical sensor data to predict component failures and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Features

- **Data Preparation** – Cleans and preprocesses IoT sensor data, handling missing values and normalizing features.
- **Feature Engineering** – Constructs meaningful variables from time‑series data to capture machine health and operational patterns.
- **Modeling** – Implements classification algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees using scikit‑learn.
- **Evaluation** – Provides metrics and visualizations to assess model performance and guide improvements.

## Files

- `sample_code.py` – Example script illustrating how to load data, preprocess it, train a model, and evaluate results.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (e.g. `pandas`, `scikit‑learn`).
2. Prepare your dataset (CSV format recommended) with a binary target indicating failure or normal operation.
3. Run `sample_code.py` and adjust the paths and parameters as needed.

The script is intended as a starting point. Feel free to expand upon it, add more sophisticated models, or integrate with real‑time data pipelines.
